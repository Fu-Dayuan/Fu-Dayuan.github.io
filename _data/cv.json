    "summary": "I am Dayuan Fu, a graduate student at PRIS-NLP Group at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by Prof. Weiran Xu. I'm visiting GAIR now, and I visited TsinghuaC3I group from 2022.10 to 2024.8. My research interests primarily focus on LLM Agents including both Agent training method and context engineering. I believe it's the way to AGI. I have published several papers at prominent NLP conferences, including ICLR, EMNLP, CIKM, and NAACL.",
